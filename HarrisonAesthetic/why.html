    <p>We want to communicate a message that branding does not have to be complex or have unique typefaces, but is really what you choose to make it.</p>
    <p>Matthew has created a brand around this simple font and color scheme because it's worth doing. The time spent making it look beautiful is what the work is about. Anyone can do it.</p>
    <p>Hopefully you enjoy looking through our branding and posters. The goal is to inspire and create appreciation for simplicity and classics.</p>
