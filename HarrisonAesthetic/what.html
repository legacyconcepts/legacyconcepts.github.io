    <p>Harrison Aesthetic is a website to showcase design and art in a unique way.</p>
    <p>The concept of the site is that design comes from creativity and what you do with what you have, not just what you have.</p>
    <p>The entire site uses the Arial font family, which is often overlooked, and utilizes high contrast colors for mood and readability.</p>
    <p>Everything done here is purely HTML and CSS, no JavaScript of Flash.</p>
    <p>Please enjoy browsing the collection of art we have here, and feel free to look over the brand guidelines we developed. We hope this can be an inspiring and beautiful experience for you. Please share.</p>
